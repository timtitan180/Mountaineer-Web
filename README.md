 This is a web app that has authentication and a backend that recognizes EJS as the UI template. I built this app to learn the database system of MONGODB and to
 have the knowledge of how to combine a server with the frontend technologies. It is still a work in progress but I think I have achieved this to be a MVP (Minimial Viable Product).
               
               
What I learned

-Templating using view engine EJS
-Node JS as a runtime enviorment
-Express to create server and handle routes 
-How to connect front end to the backend
-MongoDB
